                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am currently studying for a BSc in Computer Science at Memorial University of Newfoundland and will be graduating in September. I am interested in working in the area of software development and am actively interested in gaining experience in this field. I have strong problem solving and analytical skills, and have developed a good understanding of programming during my degree (and co-op). I am also able to work well in a team and have good communication skills.</p>
