        <h2>Always Be Building</h2>
        <p class="date">November 24, 2025</p>
        <p>
          i have 47 ideas in my notes app right now. a social app where you scroll 
          through music instead of photos. an ai persona that actually remembers 
          and evolves over time. a style engine that tells you what clothes actually 
          fit your proportions. some are good. most are probably not. i used to think 
          i needed to figure out which ones were worth building before i started.

          me before i started.
