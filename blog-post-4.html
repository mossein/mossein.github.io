        <h1>Delete More Code</h1>
        <p class="date">November 25, 2025</p>

        <p>
          last month i deleted about 40% of our codebase. not refactored. deleted. 
          it was the most productive week i've had all year.
        </p>

        <h2>how we got here</h2>
        <p>
          when you're building fast, you accumulate stuff. a feature that made sense 
          six months ago. an abstraction you built "for later." a module copied from 
          another project that you never fully understood. three different ways to 
          do the same thing because three different people built them.
        </p>
        <p>
          and if you're like us and use ai to write code (yes, we vibe code), this 
          problem compounds fast. llms are great at generating code. they're also 
          great at generating more code than you need, with extra abstractions "just 
          in case," defensive checks for things that won't happen, and patterns 
          borrowed from codebases ten times your size.
        </p>
        <p>
          none of it is bad code. that's the trap. it's all reasonable. it all works. 
          but collectively, it's friction. every new feature has to navigate around 
          old decisions. every bug could be in twelve different places. onboarding 
          someone means explaining why there are two user services.
        </p>

        <h2>what i actually deleted</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>unused feature flags.</strong> we had 47 feature flags. 31 of them 
          hadn't been touched in months. some pointed to code that no longer existed. 
          i deleted the flags and the dead code paths they guarded. nothing broke.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>the "flexible" config system.</strong> we built a system that could 
          configure anything from anywhere: environment variables, config files, 
          database, remote service. in practice, we used environment variables for 
          everything. i ripped out the abstraction and hardcoded the one pattern we 
          actually use. 400 lines gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>defensive code for impossible states.</strong> null checks on things 
          that can't be null. try/catch blocks around code that can't throw. validation 
          for data that's already validated upstream. years of "just to be safe" 
          accumulating into noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>tests for deleted features.</strong> the features were gone but the 
          tests remained, mocking things that no longer existed, passing because they 
          tested nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>the second way of doing things.</strong> we had two http clients, 
          two logging wrappers, two date formatting utilities. i picked one of each 
          and migrated everything. the "worse" option was often fine. the consistency 
          mattered more than the choice.
        </p>

        <h2>what happened after</h2>
        <p>
          build times dropped. not because of caching tricks or parallelization. 
          just less code to compile.
        </p>
        <p>
          bugs got easier to find. fewer places to look. fewer interactions to reason 
          about. i fixed a bug last week by reading the entire module. that used to 
          be impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          new features got faster to ship. not because of new tooling. because i 
          could hold the relevant context in my head. no more "wait, which service 
          handles this again?"
        </p>

        <h2>how to know what to delete</h2>
        <p>
          search for the last meaningful change. if a file hasn't been touched in 
          six months except for bulk reformatting or dependency updates, question 
          whether it needs to exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          look for code that's "handling" things. error handlers that log and rethrow. 
          wrappers that add nothing. adapters between things that could talk directly. 
          every layer has a cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          find the features nobody uses. check your analytics. talk to users. that 
          export-to-pdf feature you spent two weeks on? if nobody clicks it, delete it. 
          you can rebuild it if someone asks. they won't ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          delete the abstraction before you need the variation. we had a plugin system 
          for exactly one plugin. i inlined it. if we ever need a second plugin, i'll 
          spend an hour extracting the abstraction. probably won't happen.
        </p>

        <h2>especially if you vibe code</h2>
        <p>
          if you or your team uses ai to generate code, deletion isn't optional. it's 
          mandatory. vibe coding is fast, but it's also accumulative. you prompt, it 
          generates, you ship. the code works, so you move on. but you didn't write 
          it, so you don't fully own it mentally. it piles up.
        </p>
        <p>
          i've found that for every hour of ai-assisted coding, i need to spend 
          fifteen minutes actively deleting. not the code i just wrote, but the 
          cruft that accumulated around it. the helper functions that turned out to 
          be unnecessary. the error handling for cases that can't happen. the 
          abstractions that made sense to the model but not to me.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>every line of code is a liability. the only way to have zero bugs in a feature is to not have that feature.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>the fear</h2>
        <p>
          the hardest part isn't finding code to delete. it's convincing yourself it's 
          okay. what if we need it later? what if there's a bug and we need to debug 
          the old path? what if someone asks for that feature back?
        </p>
        <p>
          that's what version control is for. the code isn't gone. it's in git. you 
          can resurrect it in minutes. in two years of doing this, i've restored 
          deleted code exactly once.
        </p>
        <p>
          the fear of deleting is almost always worse than the reality.
        </p>

        <h2>a ritual</h2>
        <p>
          i've started doing this quarterly now. one week, no new features. just 
          deletion. i go through the codebase file by file and ask: does this need 
          to exist? is this the only way to do this thing? when was the last time 
          a human read this?
        </p>
        <p>
          it feels unproductive. your commit count goes negative. you're not shipping 
          anything visible. but the next three months feel lighter. the codebase 
          becomes something you can understand again, not just navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          the best code you write might be the code you delete.
