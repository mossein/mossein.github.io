        <h1>From Calls to Clarity: Shipping Insight Podcasts at Retellio</h1>
        <p class="date">August 14, 2025</p>

        <p>
          Product leaders don't have hours to replay customer calls. At
          Retellio, we turn long recordings into short, insight-rich podcasts
          that land where teams already work. Think five minutes of the most
          important moments from your week of conversations; delivered with
          links back to the exact quotes.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The signal is in there—objections, unmet jobs, surprise use cases—but it's buried across recordings and scattered notes.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Why insight podcasts</h2>
        <p>
          Teams get overwhelmed by volume. The signal is in there; objections,
          unmet jobs, surprise use cases; but it's buried across Zoom and Gong
          recordings, and scattered notes. Our goal is simple: surface the
          moments that matter so decisions happen faster.
        </p>

        <h2>How it fits your stack</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Plug in your tools: integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, Gong, and
            Zoom.
          </li>
          <li>
            Distribute where decisions happen: share to Slack or attach
            summaries and clips to CRM records.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trace every insight: each conclusion links back to the source moment
            in the call.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What's under the hood</h2>
        <p>
          We segment calls into moments, rank them for relevance, and generate
          structured summaries grounded in the original audio. The pipeline
          emphasizes determinism and evidence over free-form prose, so leaders
          can trust what they're hearing.
        </p>

        <h2>Anatomy of an episode</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Theme intro that sets context in under 20 seconds.</li>
          <li>Top moments with timestamps and one-line takeaways.</li>
          <li>Contrarian or outlier segment to avoid echo chambers.</li>
          <li>Risks and unknowns called out explicitly with source links.</li>
          <li>Actions and owners so follow-ups don't get lost.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ranking what makes a moment matter</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Cross-account frequency and recency to separate noise from signal.
          </li>
          <li>Sentiment shifts and stated intent changes within a call.</li>
          <li>
            Role weighting so buyer pain outranks curiosity from non-decision
            makers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity to revenue, including opportunity stage and renewal risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            Competitive mentions, blockers, and workaround hacks that hint at
            unmet jobs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A quick story</h2>
        <p>
          A fast-growing team at FactoryFix faced an avalanche of calls. With
          insight podcasts, they started catching recurring pains earlier and
          routing clips straight into their product and sales workflows.
          Leadership listened on the go, product managers tagged follow-ups with
          linked evidence, and sales pulled key objections into enablement;
          accelerating decisions without more meetings.
        </p>

        <h2>Build notes</h2>
        <p>
          We ingest from Zoom and Gong, transcribe and diarize, detect moments,
          embed for retrieval, then generate structured summaries with
          source-grounding before optional voice rendering. We emphasize
          determinism controls, PII redaction, and SOC 2 Type 2–aligned handling
          throughout the pipeline.
        </p>

        <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
        <p>
          We're exploring role-based voices for podcasts (PM, Sales, CS),
          smarter episode playlists by account, topic tracking across customer
          cohorts, and tighter CRM linking so opportunities and insights stay in
          sync. If your team wants to try insight podcasts on your calls, reach
